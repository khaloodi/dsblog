XTENDÂ® Original BCAA Powder is a muscle recovery supplement designed to help users optimize their workout results. It contains a powerful blend of 7 grams of BCAAs per serving in the ideal 2:1:1 ratio (L-Leucine, L-Isoleucine, and L-Valine) to support muscle recovery, reduce fatigue, and improve performance. Alongside BCAAs, it includes electrolytes for hydration, citrulline malate to enhance nitric oxide production, and glutamine to further aid recovery.

Available in multiple flavors like Watermelon, Blue Raspberry, and Fruit Punch, XTENDÂ® gives you plenty of variety, allowing you to switch things up to avoid taste fatigue. Whether youâ€™re an endurance athlete, bodybuilder, or weekend warrior, XTENDÂ® aims to give you the edge in your workouts.

### **Key Features & Benefits**
One of the standout features of XTENDÂ® Original BCAA Powder is its focus on muscle recovery. BCAAs are crucial for muscle repair and growth, and XTENDÂ® delivers them in the optimal 2:1:1 ratio, which is proven to help reduce muscle soreness after intense workouts. This means you can push harder in your next session without being held back by DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness).

XTENDÂ® also shines in the hydration department, thanks to the electrolytes it contains. These are essential for maintaining fluid balance and preventing cramps during extended workout sessions. Unlike many other sports drinks, XTENDÂ® is sugar-free and low-calorie, making it an ideal choice for those who are mindful of their caloric intake but still want to stay hydrated during their workout.

The inclusion of citrulline malate is another key benefit, as it can help enhance nitric oxide production, improving blood flow to muscles and increasing endurance. Whether youâ€™re lifting weights or doing high-intensity cardio, this could mean better pumps and longer-lasting energy during your workout.

### **Taste & Mixability**
When it comes to flavor, XTENDÂ® Original BCAA Powder is hard to beat. The product comes in a wide range of refreshing flavors that make it easy to sip on throughout your workout or day. Some standout options include Watermelon, Mango Madness, and Blue Raspberry Ice, all of which deliver a sweet, enjoyable taste without being overly artificial. Even those who usually avoid flavored supplements may find XTENDÂ® a pleasant surprise.

Mixability is another area where XTENDÂ® excels. The powder dissolves easily in water with minimal shaking required. Thereâ€™s no graininess or chalky residue left at the bottom of your shaker bottle, which can be a common issue with other BCAA supplements. Whether you mix it with cold water or room temperature, XTENDÂ® provides a smooth, refreshing drink.

### **Effectiveness**
The effectiveness of XTENDÂ® Original BCAA Powder largely speaks for itself, with thousands of positive reviews from users whoâ€™ve seen real results. When used consistently, many report significant reductions in muscle soreness, allowing them to hit the gym harder and more frequently. The BCAAs help preserve lean muscle mass, which is especially important if youâ€™re training in a calorie deficit or doing high-intensity workouts.

Additionally, the productâ€™s fatigue-reducing properties are noticeable, particularly during longer or more grueling workouts. You may find that you can push through that final set or sprint that extra mile without feeling as worn out. Itâ€™s particularly helpful during intra-workout when you need that mid-session boost to keep going strong.

### **Who is XTENDÂ® Best For?**
XTENDÂ® Original BCAA Powder is a versatile supplement suitable for almost anyone who engages in physical activity. Whether you're a professional athlete, a bodybuilder, or someone who enjoys regular gym sessions, XTENDÂ® can be beneficial for supporting muscle recovery and hydration. Itâ€™s especially useful for those who participate in intense weightlifting, HIIT, or endurance activities like running or cycling, as it helps reduce fatigue and muscle breakdown during prolonged physical exertion.

Even if you're a beginner or someone just starting their fitness journey, XTENDÂ® is a valuable addition to your regimen. Since it doesnâ€™t contain stimulants or caffeine, you can use it at any time of the day, making it flexible and easy to integrate into your routine.
